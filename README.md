The To-Do List Android App is a simple and efficient task manager developed on Android Studio in Kotlin/Java. 
It enables the creation, editing, and deletion of tasks while marking them as completed for better management of daily activities. 
This application holds a clean, user-friendly interface that follows the principles of Material Design, assuring smooth navigation and readability. 
Data will be locally stored with Room Database or SharedPreferences so the data remains saved in case the app restarts. On the main screen, it displays all the tasks in a RecyclerView, and with a Floating 
Action Button, 
it is easy to create a task quickly.
The code has been tested to be functional and responsive; the app executes all CRUD operations with efficiency. 
In general, it provides a simple, reliable, and visually appealing way of maintaining daily task management.
